### HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM ANALYSIS
#### Introduction
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing emergency room (ER) operations. The goal is to help hospital stakeholders monitor patient activity, service efficiency, and overall performance in real time. The dashboard supports both a monthly view and a summary view, giving users flexibility to drill down or see trends over time.

#### Problem Statement
Hospital emergency rooms are often overwhelmed by high patient volumes and operational inefficiencies. Issues such as extended wait times, low patient satisfaction, poor referral tracking, and lack of visibility into patient demographics hinder the quality of service. Without a robust system for monitoring these indicators, hospitals face challenges in improving service delivery and managing resources effectively.

#### Analysis Approach
To tackle the above challenges, the analysis was approached from both a performance and demographic perspective:
- Time-based trend analysis to track fluctuations in patient volumes, wait times, and satisfaction scores across different months and days.
- Categorical breakdowns by age, gender, race, and referral source to understand who the patients are and how they interact with the hospital system.
- Efficiency metrics such as admission rates, percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes, and daily/hourly wait time distribution.
- Dynamic filtering with slicers to allow users to explore data by year and month for more granular insights.

#### Tools Used
- Power BI: For data modeling, DAX measures, and creating the interactive dashboard visuals.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated metrics like average wait time, satisfaction score trends, and wait time intervals.

#### Key Insights
- Total Patients: 9,216 patients were recorded in the summary view, with a monthly count of 434 in February 2024.
- Wait Times: The average wait time was around 35.3 minutes overall, slightly higher at 36.1 minutes in February.
- Patient Satisfaction: Maintained a high satisfaction score, averaging 4.99 overall and 4.78 in February.
- Admission Split: Nearly a 50/50 split between admitted (50.04%) and non-admitted (49.96%) patients.
- High Referral Departments: Most referrals came from departments such as Orthopedics and Pediatrics.
- Time-Based Patterns: The highest wait times were observed mid-week (especially Wednesdays and Thursdays), with peaks in the 11–15 minute intervals.
- Demographic Trends: Most patients were between ages 25–44, with an almost even gender distribution and a diverse racial mix.

#### Impact
This dashboard enables hospital administrators and healthcare analysts to:
- Identify bottlenecks in emergency care delivery.
- ptimize staff allocation based on peak days and times.
- Improve patient satisfaction by reducing wait times.
- Target specific departments for service improvement.
- Monitor equity in service delivery across age, race, and gender groups.

#### Conclusion
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is a powerful decision-support tool that brings clarity to emergency care operations. By visualizing patient data, trends, and performance indicators in one place, it equips hospital leaders to take timely and informed actions that enhance patient experience and improve operational efficiency.
